##Description

This is Study Bro, where you can summarise an article. Because when I study normally I do it on the internet, sometimes I find it harder to read the whole article, so with Study Bro I can get a summary of that article, which helps me to be more efficient when I study. This is an API which extracts news/article body from a URL and uses GPT to summarize (and optionally translate) the article content. Useful for text mining purposes. Leverages powerful and flexible web scraping engine (ScrapeNinja.net) with high-quality rotating proxies under the hood.
 
##Instructions

If you are cloning this project, you will need to

1 - Open on the IDE , open terminal and use command : npm run dev.

##Features

Select the URL you would like to summarize and past it on the page. It takes 5 to 10 seconds to provide the summarized article. 

##Visuals

To help you better understand the flow and functionality of Study Bro, I have included a package of screenshots. These visuals will give you an insight into the application's interface and guide you through its features.

##ROADMAP

New features will be added, and the next version will be made available.
